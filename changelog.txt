* Changed license to Apache License, Version 2.0
* Requires JDK 1.6
* Fixed aggregation of TOTAL
* MongoDB backend (see http://www.mongodb.org/)
* Removed JDK selection logic for the default factory - NIO is the default one

Minor changes:

* Added RrdDbPoolNew with better concurrency (Fabrice Bacchella) + fixed issue 11
* RrdNioBackend uses ScheduledExecutorService instead of Timer (and spawns daemon, named threads)
* Fixed minor issue in FetchRequest

* Beautified RRD File Inspector
* Changed source dir to src/main/java

How to use the MongoDB backend (for more information see http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Java+Language+Center):

    // connect to localhost:27017
    Mongo mongo = new Mongo();
    mongo.setWriteConcern(WriteConcern.SAFE); // syncs write operations
    DBCollection coll = mongo.getDB("my-rrd4j-db").getCollection("my-rrds");

    RrdMongoDBBackendFactory factory = new RrdMongoDBBackendFactory(coll); // automatically set as default factory
    RrdDb rrdDb = ...

Changes in version 2.0.5
------------------------
* Reverted changes to Sample in 2.0.3 (binary searching broke storage)

Changes in version 2.0.4
------------------------
* RrdSafeFileBackend uses AtomicLong to track it's lock counters
* Fixed bugreport 2: in org.rrd4j.data.Aggregates.getAggregate(), the MIN case statement is missing. As
a result, gprint statements cannot display the minimum value of a data series as an aggregate function.
* Other minor changes

Changes in version 2.0.3
------------------------
* Major performance and locking improvements with the BerkeleyDB backend
* 10% performance improvement in the Sample class (now uses binary searching to get the correct datasource)
* JRobin RRD file compability
* Less synchronization in RrdBackendFactory
* Other minor changes

Changes in version 2.0.2
------------------------
* Minor improvements to RrdBerkeleyDbBackendFactory

* Applied patch from Renaud Bruyeron:
RrdGraphDefTemplate.resolveColors destroys COLOR_NAMES constant array, which breaks the parsing
of XML template file. Another issue fixed by the patch is that Util.Xml.getChildNodes() does not
filter out nodes that are not of type Node.ELEMENT_NODE - this breaks pretty much all the parsing
code in the *Template classes.

Changes in version 2.0.1
------------------------
* Bugfix in TimeAxis where drawing area <= 0 would throw exceptions (Ronny Standtke)
* Bugfix in Archive.accumulate (break was missing)

Changes in version 2.0 (JDK 1.5 migration)
------------------------------------------
* Bugfix in TimeAxis miscalculated when width was smaller then the endtime
* Improvement: ConsolFun and DsType are now JDK 1.5 Enum's
* Removed RrdException, replaced by IllegalArgumentException in most places
* Usage of StringBuilder to improve performance
* Sleepycat Berkeley DB backend (see http://www.sleepycat.com)
* Varargs where usefull
