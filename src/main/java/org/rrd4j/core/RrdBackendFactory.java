/**
 * Base (abstract) backend factory class which holds references to all concrete
 * backend factories and defines abstract methods which must be implemented in
 * all concrete factory implementations.<p>
 *
 * Factory classes are used to create concrete {@link RrdBackend} implementations.
 * Each factory creates unlimited number of specific backend objects.
 *
 * Rrd4j supports four different backend types (backend factories) out of the box:<p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link RrdFileBackend}: objects of this class are created from the
 * {@link RrdFileBackendFactory} class. This was the default backend used in all
 * Rrd4j releases before 1.4.0 release. It uses java.io.* package and RandomAccessFile class to store
 * RRD data in files on the disk.
 *
 * <li>{@link RrdSafeFileBackend}: objects of this class are created from the
 * {@link RrdSafeFileBackendFactory} class. It uses java.io.* package and RandomAccessFile class to store
 * RRD data in files on the disk. This backend is SAFE:
 * it locks the underlying RRD file during update/fetch operations, and caches only static
 * parts of a RRD file in memory. Therefore, this backend is safe to be used when RRD files should
 * be shared <b>between several JVMs</b> at the same time. However, this backend is *slow* since it does
 * not use fast java.nio.* package (it's still based on the RandomAccessFile class).
 *
 * <li>{@link RrdNioBackend}: objects of this class are created from the
 * {@link RrdNioBackendFactory} class. The backend uses java.io.* and java.nio.*
 * classes (mapped ByteBuffer) to store RRD data in files on the disk. This is the default backend
 * since 1.4.0 release.
 *
 * <li>{@link RrdMemoryBackend}: objects of this class are created from the
 * {@link RrdMemoryBackendFactory} class. This backend stores all data in memory. Once
 * JVM exits, all data gets lost. The backend is extremely fast and memory hungry.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Each backend factory is identified by its {@link #getName() name}. Constructors
 * are provided in the {@link RrdDb} class to create RrdDb objects (RRD databases)
 * backed with a specific backend.<p>
 *
 * See javadoc for {@link RrdBackend} to find out how to create your custom backends.
